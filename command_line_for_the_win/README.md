These are screenshots of my progress in the CMDCHALLENGE.

CMD CHALLENGE is a fantastic game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s excellent training to improve your command line skills!

Here is the SFTP command line followed to upload the screenshots:
  * sftp ********@*******.******.alx-cod.online
  * enter the sandbox password to confirm the connection
  * navigate to the directory where I want to upload the screenshots, cd alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win
  * Upload the screenshots by the command "put".
